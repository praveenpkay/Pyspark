My personal hands on learning Pyspark for Jr. ETL Developer role. 
I took an an IPL dataset, formulated my own problem statements.
Learnt how to extract the asked information through Data transformation functions of RDD. 

Some questions inclue (ex):
1. Which Team has had most D/L matches. 
2. How is game toss affecting game result.
3. Most win % team.
4. Highest number of standings for an umpire.
5. Venue and its bias towards game result.
